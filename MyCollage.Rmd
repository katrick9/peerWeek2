##Peer-graded Assignment: R Markdown and Leaflet

## Introduction

This project was created as part of the Developing Data Products course of the Coursera [Data Science Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). The goal of the project is to create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet, and to host the resulting web page on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

## Map

```{r}
library(leaflet)
my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=23.4123, lng= 85.4399, popup="My Collage")
my_map
